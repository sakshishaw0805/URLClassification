# URLClassification
This project presents a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the detection of malicious URLs. We used several classifiers, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Support Vector Machine, on a dataset of approximately 15,000 labeled URLs from Kaggle. The process includes URL preprocessing, extracting the features using TF-IDF vectorizer, and lastly tuning the parameters with the help of randomized search with cross-validation. Ensemble methods such as Extra Trees surpassed simpler approaches, with a highest accuracy of 92.57%, followed by Random Forest 92.13%, and SVM 92.03%.
